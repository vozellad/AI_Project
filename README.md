Developing an AI Tool for Determining Service Performance of USPS Offices by Location

The delivery services of USPS are expected to successfully ship what they are given. 
Mistakes are inevitable, but some offices have issues that cause them to frequently fail to deliver mail and packages. 
Analyzing the successful delivery percentages of USPS offices may highlight which offices have issues with delivering mail. 
By knowing what offices are having problems, this helps USPS and its customers. 
USPS is able to focus on the problematic offices and increase their overall success frequency. 
The AI solution can also have a consumer version so customers can select better offices near their shipping destination to ship to and have their mail successfully shipped more often.
